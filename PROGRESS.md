# SAE Development Progress

## Phase 1: Desktop Setup ✅
- [x] Git for Windows installed and configured
- [x] SSH keys created (github, homelab, sae_lab)
- [x] VS Code installed with extensions
- [x] Docker Desktop installed and running
- [x] WSL 2 integration confirmed

## Phase 2: Basic Configuration ✅
- [x] SSH config file created with dual-key approach
- [x] Passwordless sudo configured for labrat user
- [x] User accounts created (ansible, automation)
- [x] SSH keys deployed with proper ownership
- [x] All automation connections tested and working
- [x] Development directory structure created
- [x] Git repository initialized with security .gitignore
- [x] Ansible inventory created

## SSH Connection Summary
**Manual Administration:**
- homelab-control, homelab-git, homelab-docker, homelab-siem (labrat user)

**Automation Access:**
- sae-control (ansible user)
- sae-git, sae-docker, sae-siem (automation user)

## Phase 3: Planning (Post SC-300)
- [ ] Control node automation requirements
- [ ] Target VM baseline configuration
- [ ] Automation project workflows
- [ ] Secrets management implementation

## Next Steps (July 2025)
1. Configure control node with Ansible/Terraform
2. Create baseline automation playbooks
3. Implement first automation projects
4. Begin portfolio documentation

## Lessons Learned
- **Sudo Ownership Issue**: Using sudo tee creates root-owned files
- **Solution**: Always run sudo chown immediately after sudo file operations
- **Passwordless Sudo**: Essential for automation workflows
- **Dual-Key Strategy**: Separate keys for manual vs automated access
